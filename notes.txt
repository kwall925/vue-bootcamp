<Vue JS>

PT1/PT2
Versatility
  -use for entire app,
  or just for components

Virtual DOM
  -Uses custom JS objects to
  build elements
  -Is a layer between Vue and
  the real DOM

  Patching:
    -matching the virtual
    DOM with the real DOM
    -these are the changes that
    need to be made to match DOM's.
    -these changes are stored as a
    queue
    -TICK: the process of moving from
    patching to the creation of a brand
    new DOM
    -patching process removes VUE-only
    code
    -this process is also referred to as
    DOM diffing

Understanding Reactivity
  -if data changes, computer
  properties are automatically
  recomputed
  -this is what makes it a "computed property"
  rather than a simple variable. its computed on
  the fly
  -computed properties are added to Vue using the
  computed: {} object

V-Model
  -ties an HTML input field
  to a data property in Vue
  -example : <input name="field" v-model="field" />

Computed properties are getters only
  -this makes things difficult when
  data needs to be manipulated as it
  is coming in

Methods
  -Methods vs computed properties:
    methods do not have computed properties

  Interpolations
    -v-once: does not allow for repeating
      with Interpolations
    -v-html: write HTML directly in your Vue code;
      omits double curly brace syntax

  Conditional Rendering (using IF statements)
    -use v-if within html tags to render
      data based on certain conditions
    <template></template>
      special Vue syntax:
      evaluates all the js in all of the
      divs that are wrapped inside template
    -more complex conditionals will use
      v-else and v-else-if
    -keep in mind that these rendering statements
      are destructive to the DOM (it is not simply
      hiding and showing data)

  Looping
    -v-for="i in 5"
      -prints content of div 5 times
    -this is not 0 based indexing

  Class Binding
    -tie classes to elements using Vue's
      data driven approach (v-bind:class)
    -apply classes as objects and tie them
      to conditions:
      <div v-bind:class="{ 'danger': isDanger }">Text</div>
    -array syntax can also be used for class
      bindings -- this allows you to use
      mulitple classes

  Inline Styling
    -v-bind:style
      <div v-bind:style="{ color: 'red' }">Text</div>

  Components
    -Loosely defined:
      "Extraction of a single element"
    -The perfect tool for reusability
      and encapsulation
    -Can divide your app into small pieces
    -Components use every feature of Vue
    -Components only re-render when necessary
      which is fantastic for DOM updates

  Vue.component('name', {})

  template: defines html

  data: must contain a function() that
    returns something

  slots: seem confusing and verbose, but are
    the best way to push data into components

  props: Vue's unique way of calling attributes.
    stored as an array: props: ['userId']
