<Vue JS>

PT1/PT2
Versatility
  -use for entire app,
  or just for components

Virtual DOM
  -Uses custom JS objects to
  build elements
  -Is a layer between Vue and
  the real DOM

  Patching:
    -matching the virtual
    DOM with the real DOM
    -these are the changes that
    need to be made to match DOM's.
    -these changes are stored as a
    queue
    -TICK: the process of moving from
    patching to the creation of a brand
    new DOM
    -patching process removes VUE-only
    code
    -this process is also referred to as
    DOM diffing

Understanding Reactivity
  -if data changes, computer
  properties are automatically
  recomputed
  -this is what makes it a "computed property"
  rather than a simple variable. its computed on
  the fly
  -computed properties are added to Vue using the
  computed: {} object

V-Model
  -ties an HTML input field
  to a data property in Vue
  -example : <input name="field" v-model="field" />

Computed properties are getters only
  -this makes things difficult when
  data needs to be manipulated as it
  is coming in

Methods
  -Methods vs computed properties:
    methods do not have computed properties

  Interpolations
    -v-once: does not allow for repeating
      with Interpolations
    -v-html: write HTML directly in your Vue code;
      omits double curly brace syntax
